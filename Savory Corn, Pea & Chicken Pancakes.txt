Pancake batter:
150 g flour (1 cup + 2 tbsp)
2 eggs
250 ml milk (1 cup)
Pinch of salt
1 tbsp melted butter or oil (plus more for frying)

Filling:
150 g cooked chicken breast (shredded or chopped)
100 g sweet corn (fresh or canned)
100 g green peas (fresh or frozen)
1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)
50 g grated cheese (e.g., cheddar or mozzarella ‚Äì optional)
Salt & pepper to taste

üë©‚Äçüç≥ Instructions

Make the batter:
In a bowl, whisk together the flour, eggs, and a pinch of salt. 
Gradually add the milk while whisking until you get a smooth batter. 
Stir in the melted butter. Let rest for 10 minutes.

Prepare the filling:
Heat a little oil in a pan. Saut√© the onion until soft (if using). 
Add the chicken, peas, and corn. Season with salt and pepper. 
Heat through and stir in herbs and cheese if using.

Combine or layer:
You have two options:
‚Ä¢ Mix everything together: Stir the chicken/veg mix directly into the batter.
‚Ä¢ Layer: Cook plain pancakes and fill them afterward like wraps.

Cook the pancakes:
Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat with a little oil. 
Pour in a ladle of batter and spread out. 
Cook 2‚Äì3 minutes on each side until golden. 
If you added the filling to the batter, cook them just a bit longer 
on lower heat to ensure the inside warms through.

Serve hot:
Top with a dollop of sour cream, cr√®me fra√Æche, or even a spicy sauce. 
Add a side salad for a full meal.
