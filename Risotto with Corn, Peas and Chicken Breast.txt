üë©‚Äçüç≥ Instructions
Cook the chicken:
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan. Saut√© the chicken pieces until golden and cooked through. 
Season with salt and pepper. Remove and set aside.

Start the risotto:
In the same pan (or a new one), heat the remaining oil or butter. 
Saut√© the onion until soft and translucent (about 3 minutes). 
Add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.

Add the rice:
Stir in the risotto rice and toast it for 1‚Äì2 minutes until the grains look shiny.

Add stock gradually:
Pour in a ladleful of warm chicken stock and stir until fully absorbed. 
Continue adding the stock one ladle at a time, stirring frequently. 
Cook for about 20 minutes until the rice is creamy and al dente.

Add vegetables and chicken:
After about 15 minutes of cooking, stir in the peas, corn, and cooked chicken. 
Let them heat through as the risotto finishes cooking.

Finish and serve:
Remove from the heat and stir in the grated Parmesan cheese. 
Taste and season with salt, pepper, and a splash of lemon juice if desired.
