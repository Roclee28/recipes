🧾 Ingredients (for 2 burgers)

For the patties:
250 g ground beef (80/20 fat ratio is ideal)
Salt & black pepper
Optional: ½ tsp garlic powder or onion powder

Toppings:
• 2 slices of cheese (e.g., cheddar, gouda, American, or your favorite meltable cheese)
• 2 burger buns
• Lettuce leaves
• Tomato slices
• Pickles or onions (optional)
• Ketchup, mustard, mayo, or burger sauce

👩‍🍳 Instructions

Form the patties:
Divide the ground beef into 2 equal parts. 
Gently shape into round patties about 1.5 – 2 cm thick. 
Press a small indent in the center with your thumb (prevents puffing). 
Season both sides with salt and pepper.

Cook the patties:
• In a hot skillet or on the grill, cook the burgers for about 
3–4 minutes per side (medium) or longer if you prefer well done.
• In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top 
and cover the pan with a lid or foil to melt it.

Toast the buns (optional but tasty):
Slice and lightly toast the buns in a dry pan or on the grill until golden.

Assemble the burger:
Bottom bun → sauce → lettuce → burger with cheese → tomato → pickles/onion → top bun.
